# Email Signature

### Author: Shibin George

To be frank, the HTML/CSS code has been shamelessly copied from a template provided by https://htmlsig.com.
Since images in the signature have to be hosted on a public server, I thought of hosting mine in a github repository.

##What did I do?

1) Designed a free template from htmlsig.com.

2) Downloaded the html content, icons and other pictures from the URLs in the html file.

3) Uploaded the asset-files to github repo and updated the resource links in the html file.

4) Open the html file in any browser.

5) Copy the entire content and paste in the Gmail signature field.

A Hat tip to both Github and htmlsig.com !


Feel free to borrow/fork this repo for your use.
